<p>apparently you can't have a readme and an index.html</p>
<p>I will make this good soon</p>
<p>pls make me a mod</p>
<p>
  So I have to learn the Facebook SDK to actually get posts on here, 
  but it is an open group so I don't think I have to be a mod. Hopefully 
  I can make this a good skin of the website because Facebook is bad.
